 * Get the length of a null-terminated string.

 * 2. Iterates over each character in the string until a null character is encountered.
 * 3. Increments the `len` variable by 1 for each character encountered.
 * 4. Returns the final value of `len`, which represents the length of the string.

 * @param str The null-terminated string for which to calculate the length.
 *
 * @return The length of the string.
