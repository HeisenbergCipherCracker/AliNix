 * 3. Set the first character of `foo` to the corresponding hexadecimal digit of the most significant 4 bits of `key`.
 * 4. Set the second character of `foo` to the corresponding hexadecimal digit of the least significant 4 bits of `key`.
 * 5. Call the `Write` function to write `foo` to the console.
