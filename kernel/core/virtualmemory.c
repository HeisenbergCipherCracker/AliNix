/**
 * Map a virtual address to a physical address in the page table.
 *
 * This function maps a virtual address to a physical address in the page table. It performs the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Retrieves the page table entry for the virtual address using the `GetPageForAddress` function.
 * 2. Sets the frame field of the page table entry to the physical address divided by the page size.
 * 3. Sets the isUser field of the page table entry based on the value of the `kernel` parameter.
 * 4. Sets the readWrite field of the page table entry based on the value of the `writeable` parameter.
 * 5. Sets the present field of the page table entry to 1.
 * 6. Invalidates the TLB entry for the virtual address using the `invlpg` function.
 *
 * @param physAddress The physical address to map.
 * @param virtAddress The virtual address to map.
 * @param kernel Indicates whether the mapping is for the kernel or user space.
 * @param writeable Indicates whether the mapping is writeable.
 *
 * @return void
