/**
 * @brief Convert a little-endian 32-bit value to the CPU's native endianness.
 *
 * This function converts a little-endian 32-bit value to the CPU's native endianness.
 * If the system is little-endian, no conversion is needed. If the system is big-endian,
 * the function performs a byte-swapping operation to convert the value from little-endian
 * to big-endian or vice versa.
 *
 * @param le_value The little-endian 32-bit value to convert.
 * @return The converted 32-bit value in the CPU's native endianness.
 *
 * @note This function is useful when dealing with data that is stored in a specific
 *       endianness, such as network protocols or disk formats.
