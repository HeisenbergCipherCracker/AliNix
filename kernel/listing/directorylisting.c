/**
 * Begin listing files in a directory.
 *
 * @param thread Pointer to the thread structure.
 * @param pathPtr Pointer to the path string.
 *
 * @note This function begins listing files in a directory specified by the `path` parameter.
 *       It takes a pointer to the `Thread` structure and a pointer to the path string as parameters.
 *       The `Thread` structure is used to store information about the thread executing the function.
 *       The `path` parameter is a pointer to the path string, which specifies the directory to list files from.
 *       The function does not return any value.
 *
 * @example
 * // Begin listing files in a directory
 * struct Thread* thread = ...;
 * uint32_t pathPtr = ...;
 * BeginListing(thread, pathPtr);
 *
 * @see EndListing()
 * @see ListNextFile()
