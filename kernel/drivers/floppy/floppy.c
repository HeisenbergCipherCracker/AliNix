/**
 * @brief Resets the floppy disk controller and waits for the IRQ.
 * 
 * This function sends a reset signal to the floppy disk controller and then waits for
 * an interrupt request (IRQ) to ensure that the reset has been successfully completed.
 * 
 * @details The function relies on an external `WaitForIRQ` function to handle the waiting 
 * for the IRQ. The specifics of the reset process, such as sending the reset signal, 
 * are assumed to be handled elsewhere in the code.
 * 
 * @note Ensure that the `WaitForIRQ` function is correctly implemented to properly wait 
 * for the IRQ, as this function depends on it for synchronization.
