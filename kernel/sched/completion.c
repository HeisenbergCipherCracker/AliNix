 *
 * @param x A pointer to a struct completion object representing the completion event.
 * @param action A pointer to a function that takes a long argument and returns a long value.
 *               This function is used to perform an action while waiting for the completion event.

 * @param state An int value representing the state of the completion event.
 *
 * @return A long value representing the timeout value.
